Gliaswap is an open-source AMM DEX template on Nervos. It's a complete production-ready DEX implementation, including on-chain smart contracts and off-chain components. Everyone is welcome to fork, modify and deploy your version.

Gliaswap provides the basic functionality of AMM DEX. Users can swap their cryptocurrencies, while Users can become automated liquidity providers to generate trading fees on Gliaswap. 

Gliaswap serves also as a demonstration of [Universal App built on Nervos](_https://www.nervos.org/_) that allows users to trade ETH with CKB by using only one wallet. Such trade on Gliaswap means that users can choose their preferred wallet and still be able to trade different assets cross-chain.
